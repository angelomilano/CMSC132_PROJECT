Program counter (PC0-PC3)

1) Read file
2) Convert opcodes into instructions and store the instructions into an ARRAY
3) Decode each instructions and store variables

Insert all the instructions in an array
ready first instruction
for fetch, these are the conditions:
	if in the current clock cycle has M (memory access)
		stall
		wait for the clock cycle wherein M is finished
		clock rise (meaning fetch is successful)
		point the location in the array where the value must be placed
	otherwise
		clock rise (meaning fetch is successful)
		point the location in the array where the value must be placed
